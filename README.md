# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## Introduction
Hello, I'm Riquelme. I have a strong passion for Software Engineering. I am currently majoring in Control and Automation Engineering at UFMG and participating in an exchange program at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, where I am studying Computer Science to further enhance my skills.

## Professional journey
Throughout my educational journey, I was accepted into two technical colleges in Brazil at the age of 15—CEFET-MG, where I studied electrotechnical engineering, and IFMG, where I was offered a place to study automation. I chose to pursue electrotechnical engineering at CEFET-MG, and during my high school years, I actively participated in extracurricular activities. I first joined a competitive aerospace group and later engaged in a scientific initiation in robotics, where I first encountered programming.

After completing high school, I took the ENEM exam, a prerequisite for university admission in Brazil. My high score enabled me to gain admission to several universities. Ultimately, I chose to attend UFMG, where I began my studies in Control and Automation Engineering. By my third semester, I was involved in another scientific initiation at CDTN (Centro de Desenvolvimento da Tecnologia Nuclear), where I developed a man-machine interface to control machinery used in nuclear research.

My journey then led me to the University of Jyväskylä in Finland as part of an exchange program. Here, I am further enhancing my programming skills and gaining international exposure in the field of Computer Science.
